#  THIS VERSION OF CARD WORKOUT IS DONE USING PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH

1. Usually the best way to approach the code layout in ViewController is to keep the app logic and
   functionality on the top and all the UI code at the bottom.
2. Remember - you can add SF SYMBOLS to your BUTTONS.
3. To see default Apple look done for UIButtons, i.e. tinted and SF Symbols, please see CWButton project file.
